Codebook

I am including here only the more relevant variables. The rest of the information in the output file includes internal variables that are probably not useful for analysis. 

obj_file	relative path and name of the object file
enc_trialN	trial number in the encoding phase
trial_cond	internal coding
scn_condition	prior strength (1 = flat, 2 = weak, 3 = strong)
scn_cat	scene category shown at encoding
scn_inst	scene instance shown at encoding
fillers	is this trial a filler? 1 yes, 0 no
obj_cat	object category (label)
obj_cat_num	object category (number)
quadrant	on screen position
key_resp_trial.keys	response in the encoding task
key_resp_trial.rt	rection time in the encoding task
trial_acc	accuracy in the encoding task
group	inmediate vs delayed memory test (24 h)
practice	is this a practice trial? 1 yes, 0 no
participant.y	participant ID for the memory test
OvsN	is this an old trial? 1 old, 2 new
contingency	task-wide likelihood of seeing that object category in that context
key_resp_id.keys	response in the object recognition memory test
key_resp_id.rt	reaction time in the object recognition memory test
key_resp_conf.keys	confidence rating in the object recognition memory test (1 “very sure”, 2 “sure””, 3  “unsure”, 4 “very unsure”)
key_resp_assoc.keys	response to the object-scene association test
key_resp_assoc.rt	reaction time in the object-scene association memory test
key_resp_loc.keys	response in the object location memory test
key_resp_loc.rt	response time in the object location memory test
rec_trialN	trial number in the memory test
id_acc	accuracy in the recognition memory test
assoc.acc	accuracy in the association memory test
cond_assoc	accuracy in the recognition memory test (conditional to id_acc)
loc.acc	accuracy in the location memory test
cond_loc	accuracy in the location memory test (conditional to id_acc)
PE_level	1 – task-wide likelihood of  seeing that object category in that context
session	memory session (1, immediate, 2 delayed)
participant.x	participant ID for the encoding task
