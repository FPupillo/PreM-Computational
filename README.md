Most scripts contained in this repository can be run in R. 
Version used: R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23).
R is a free software that can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
Some scripts are written in bash script. These scripts usually manage several R scripts at once. 

Description of the folders and files:
# computational_model
Scripts related to computational modeling of the data
## analysis_files
Files used to compute descriptive and inferential analyses on the data
### 01.cumAccByScene_learnVsEnc.R
Scripts that calculates the cumulative accuracy by scene.
### 02.ModelFree_analyses.R
Analyses of participants' performance without computationally-derived values. 
### 03.analysis_model-derivedPE_memory.Rmd
Analyses of the computatinally-derived PE
### S.01.analysis_signed_model-derivedPE_memory.Rmd
Supplementary analysis of the signed model_derivedPE on memory. 
### S.CI.Rdata
Data object containing the bootstrapped Confidence Intervals for the regression coefficient of the main model. 
## figures
Plots created by the different scripts. 
## fitting_functins
Functions used to fit the different computational models. 
## fitting_scripts
Scripts that fit the computational models to participants' data. 
## helper_functions
Custom functions that are used by the other scripts. 
## likelihood_functions
Functions that compute the likelihood for the different computational models. 
## output_files
Files created by the different scripts. 
## parameter_estimation
Scripts that estimate the single subjects' parameters. 
## parameter_recovery
Scripts used to assess parameters' recoverability and print diagnostic plots. 
## simulation_functions
Scripts that simulate the data. They are used for both parameter and model recovery. 
## Table S1

### 01.runParameterRecovery.sh
Bash script which performs parameter recovery
### 02.runModel.R
Script that performs model recovery. 
### 03.plotConfusionMatrix.R
Scripts that plots the confusion matrix to check model recovery. 
### 04.runParameterEstimation.sh
Bash script file that runs the parameter estimation for the different computational model. 
### 05.modelComparison_comparefit.R
Scripts that compare the fit of the different models and outputs the results.
### 06.fitModels.sh
Fitting the best-fitting models to participants' data to estimate PE. 
### 07.compare_simulatedvsempirical.R
Validating the models by comparing syntetic behavioural data generated by the models and actual participants' data. 
### 08.MasterScript.sh
File that runs all the previous steps sequentially. 
## codebook.md
Description of the variables contained in the raw data. 
## exp1
Raw data and computationally-derived data for Experiment 1. 
## exp2
Raw data and computationally-derived data for Experiment 2. 
### PREMUP_computational.Rproj
