Files and analysis scripts reported in the paper "The Effect of Prediction Error on Episodic Memory
Encoding is modulated by the Outcome of the Predictions". 

The scripts contained in this repository are written in bash and R languages. 
Version used: R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23).
R is a free software that can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
The scripts written in bash are used to manage several R scripts at once. 

# Learning Performance
The visualization and analysis of learning performance for the practice and encoding tasks is carried out in the script `scripts/analysis_files/01.cumAccByScene_learnVsEnc.R`. 

# Computational Models
**Parameter Recovery** is carried out by the bash script `01.runParameterRecovery.sh`. The scripts used are in the folder `parameter_recovery`. 
There are four different files which perform recovery for the four different models considered in the paper. 
These scripts use the simulation, likelihood, and fitting functions contained in the folders `simulation_functions`, `likelihood_functions`, and `fitting_functions`, respectively. 

**Model Recovery** is performed by the `02.runModelRecover.R` script. 
The script `03.plotConfusionMatrix.R` plots the confusion matrix after the model recovery process has been run. 

**Model comparison** is performed by the script `05.modelComparison_comparefit.R`. 

The script `06.fitModles.sh` fits the models and extract computationally-derived quantities. 

The script `07.compare_simulatedvsempirical.R` compare the simulated data with the empirical data.  

The file `01.cumAccByScene_learnVsEnc.R` creates cumulative accuracy
by scene for learning and encoding separately. 

The file `02.ModelFree_analyses_agg.R"

# Model-derived PE and memory
The file `02_ModelFree_analyses.R` contains the scripts for visualizing and analyzing the data as a function of the condition of the predicted category. These analyses are included in the Supplementary Material
